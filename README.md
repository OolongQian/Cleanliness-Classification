## COOL: Contour and Object-Oriented Learning for Indoor Cleanliness Classification

## Abstract
<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">The evaluation of indoor cleanliness is a meaningful task for vision-based household service systems. However, the perception of cleanliness is determined by diverse visual features and multiple criteria, which is subjective to the observer. We find the existing dataset and method fail to truthfully capture the concept of cleanliness because the feature used is not representative to human subjective judgement. Therefore, we create a dataset for indoor cleanliness classification from a group of annotators based on SUN-RGBD, a richly annotated scene understanding benchmark. Based on such analysis, we propose Contour and Object-oriented Learning (COOL) model that integrates pretrained convolutional feature, low-level contour feature, and object arrangement in order to truthfully model the notion of cleanliness. Our design choices are justified in ablation studies, and our model outperforms the previous method in our dataset for cleanliness classification.</span>
